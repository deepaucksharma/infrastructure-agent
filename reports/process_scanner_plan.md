# Work Plan: process_scanner

## Overview
Implement a robust and efficient process scanner that gathers information about running processes on the host system. The scanner must efficiently handle process lifecycle events, manage system resources carefully, and provide reliable process data to consumers such as the Top-N sampler.

## Blueprint Alignment
- **Epic**: A1-E0 - Process Information Collection
- **Story**: A1-S1 - Process Scanner Refactoring
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - gather process information (PID, name, command, CPU, RSS) from host
  - handle process lifecycle events (creation, termination)
  - limit CPU usage to ≤ 0.75% during scanning
  - handle up to 3000 processes without performance degradation
  - deliver process updates to registered consumers
  - provide proper error handling for platform-specific operations

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Files to Modify
- None (new module)

### 2. New Files to Create
- `infrastructure-agent/collector/collector.go`: Core interfaces for the collector module
- `infrastructure-agent/collector/config.go`: Configuration parameters
- `infrastructure-agent/collector/process_scanner.go`: Main process scanner implementation
- `infrastructure-agent/collector/process_scanner_test.go`: Unit tests for scanner
- `infrastructure-agent/collector/process_info.go`: Process information structures
- `infrastructure-agent/collector/platform/platform.go`: Platform abstraction interfaces
- `infrastructure-agent/collector/platform/linux.go`: Linux-specific implementations
- `infrastructure-agent/collector/platform/windows.go`: Windows-specific implementations
- `infrastructure-agent/collector/platform/darwin.go`: macOS-specific implementations
- `infrastructure-agent/collector/metrics.go`: Metrics for scanner performance
- `infrastructure-agent/collector/consumer.go`: Consumer registration and notification

### 3. Implementation Steps
1. Define core interfaces and data structures for process information
   - Process information model with all required fields
   - Consumer interface for delivering updates
   - Platform abstraction interface
   
2. Implement configuration system with sensible defaults
   - Scan interval configuration
   - Resource limits and thresholds
   - Platform-specific settings

3. Create platform-specific implementations for process data collection
   - Linux: Parse /proc filesystem for process data
   - Windows: Use Windows Management Interface (WMI) or similar
   - macOS: Use libproc or similar

4. Develop process scanner core functionality
   - Scanning loop with configurable interval
   - Process tracking with efficient data structures
   - Lifecycle event detection
   - Resource usage calculation

5. Implement consumer registration and notification system
   - Callback-based notification
   - Support for multiple consumers
   - Thread-safe registration/deregistration

6. Add resource management features
   - Self-monitoring for CPU usage
   - Adaptive scanning rate
   - Circuit breaker for high-load situations

7. Build robust error handling
   - Platform-specific error detection
   - Graceful degradation
   - Detailed error reporting and retry logic

8. Implement metrics collection
   - Scanner performance metrics
   - Process statistics
   - Error tracking

9. Write comprehensive unit tests
   - Mock platform implementations for testing
   - Lifecycle event testing
   - Resource limit testing
   - Consumer notification testing

10. Update documentation and runbook
    - Add process scanner configuration documentation
    - Document metrics and error handling
    - Add operational scenarios

### 4. Test Plan
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Test process information gathering
  - Test lifecycle event detection
  - Test consumer notification
  - Test resource limit enforcement
  - Test error handling
  - Test configuration validation

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test with Top-N sampler integration
  - Test with high process count
  - Test with rapid process creation/termination
  - Test CPU usage during scanning

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Benchmark scanner with varying numbers of processes
  - Benchmark CPU usage during scanning
  - Benchmark memory usage
  - Benchmark impact of scan interval on accuracy vs. resource usage

### 5. Documentation Updates
- `docs/runbook.md`: Add section on process scanner, configuration parameters, and troubleshooting
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`: Add entry for process scanner implementation

## Potential Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Platform-specific issues with process data collection
  - **Mitigation**: Robust error handling and platform abstraction
- **Risk**: High CPU usage during scanning of many processes
  - **Mitigation**: Implement adaptive scanning and throttling
- **Risk**: Memory leaks from tracking terminated processes
  - **Mitigation**: Proper cleanup and reference management
- **Risk**: Race conditions in consumer notification
  - **Mitigation**: Thread-safe implementation with proper synchronization

## Success Metrics
- CPU Usage: ≤ 0.75% during scanning
- Memory Usage: ≤ 30MB when tracking 3000 processes
- Scan Time: ≤ 100ms for 1000 processes
- Notification Latency: ≤ 10ms for consumer updates
- Error Rate: ≤ 0.1% failed scans

## Estimated Effort
- Implementation: 3-4 days
- Testing: 1-2 days
- Documentation: 0.5 days
