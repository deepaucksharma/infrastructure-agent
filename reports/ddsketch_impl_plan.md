# Work Plan: ddsketch_impl

## Overview
Implement the DDSketch (Distributed Distribution Sketch) algorithm for accurate and memory-efficient percentile calculations with guaranteed relative error bounds. DDSketch is designed for distributed environments and provides accuracy guarantees for quantile estimation, making it ideal for our telemetry foundation.

## Blueprint Alignment
- **Epic**: A2-E1 - Statistical Aggregation
- **Story**: A2-S2 - DDSketch Implementation
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - p95/p99 error ≤ 1% with γ = 0.0075
  - efficient memory usage with sparse representation
  - serialization/deserialization support for transport
  - merge capability for distributed aggregation
  - threadsafe operations for concurrent updates

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Files to Modify
- None (new module)

### 2. New Files to Create
- `infrastructure-agent/sketch/sketch.go`: Core interface definitions
- `infrastructure-agent/sketch/config.go`: Configuration parameters
- `infrastructure-agent/sketch/ddsketch.go`: Main DDSketch implementation
- `infrastructure-agent/sketch/ddsketch_test.go`: Unit tests for DDSketch
- `infrastructure-agent/sketch/store.go`: Bucket store implementations (dense/sparse)
- `infrastructure-agent/sketch/store_test.go`: Unit tests for bucket stores
- `infrastructure-agent/sketch/serialization.go`: Serialization/deserialization logic
- `infrastructure-agent/sketch/serialization_test.go`: Unit tests for serialization

### 3. Implementation Steps
1. Define the core interfaces and configuration structures 
2. Implement the sparse bucket store with efficient memory usage
   - Use map-based implementation for sparse data
   - Implement automatic collapsing for low-count buckets
3. Implement the dense bucket store for performance-critical paths
   - Use array-based implementation for dense data
   - Optimize for fast updates in hot paths
4. Create the DDSketch implementation with the following features:
   - Configurable relative accuracy parameter (γ)
   - Dynamic store selection (sparse/dense)
   - Thread-safe operations
   - Efficient memory usage
   - Min/max value tracking
5. Implement merging functionality for distributed aggregation
   - Efficient merge of multiple sketches
   - Proper handling of different parameters
6. Add serialization/deserialization support
   - Protocol buffer based serialization
   - Forward/backward compatibility
7. Write comprehensive unit tests covering:
   - Accuracy guarantees under various distributions
   - Memory efficiency
   - Thread safety
   - Merge operations
   - Serialization/deserialization
8. Implement benchmarks for critical operations
9. Add documentation and update runbook
10. Update CHANGELOG.md

### 4. Test Plan
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Test accuracy with uniform distribution
  - Test accuracy with normal distribution
  - Test accuracy with exponential distribution
  - Test accuracy with bimodal distribution
  - Test accuracy with pathological distributions
  - Test relative error guarantees for p95/p99
  - Test sparse store memory efficiency
  - Test merge operations
  - Test concurrent operations
  - Test serialization/deserialization

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test with simulated process metrics
  - Test aggregation across multiple agents
  - Test error bounds in distributed environment

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Benchmark update operations
  - Benchmark quantile estimation
  - Benchmark merge operations
  - Benchmark memory usage
  - Benchmark serialization/deserialization

### 5. Documentation Updates
- `docs/runbook.md`: Add section on DDSketch, configuration parameters, and accuracy guarantees
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`: Add entry for DDSketch implementation

## Potential Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Memory usage grows unbounded with unique values
  - **Mitigation**: Implement bucket collapsing strategy for sparse store
- **Risk**: Accuracy degrades with certain distributions
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing with various distributions
- **Risk**: Concurrent updates cause data corruption
  - **Mitigation**: Proper synchronization mechanisms
- **Risk**: Serialized size too large for transport
  - **Mitigation**: Compress sparse representations, only serialize non-empty buckets

## Success Metrics
- p95/p99 error: ≤ 1% across all test distributions
- Memory usage: Efficient scaling with unique values count
- Update performance: < 100ns per sample
- Merge performance: Linear with number of buckets
- Thread safety: No failures under high concurrency

## Estimated Effort
- Implementation: 2-3 days
- Testing: 1-2 days
- Documentation: 0.5 days
