## Documentation Updates
- **Runbook**: Added comprehensive sections on DDSketch implementation:
  - Configuration parameters
  - Metrics and events
  - Diagnostic procedures for statistical accuracy issues and memory usage growth
  - Operational scenarios for:
    - Optimizing DDSketch for accuracy vs. memory
    - Distributed aggregation setup
- **Changelog**: Added entries for DDSketch implementation and core sketch module

## Implementation Notes
The implementation follows the algorithm described in the paper "DDSketch: A fast and fully-mergeable quantile sketch with relative-error guarantees" by Masson, Rim, Lee. 

Key technical decisions:
1. **Dual store implementation**: Both sparse (map-based) and dense (array-based) stores were implemented to optimize for different data distributions.
2. **Automatic store switching**: The implementation can dynamically switch between store types based on observed density.
3. **Bucket collapsing**: Sparse store implements automatic bucket collapsing to maintain memory efficiency.
4. **Thread safety**: Fine-grained locking ensures safety under concurrent access while minimizing contention.
5. **Serialization**: Compact binary format with version support for future compatibility.

The relative accuracy parameter (γ = 0.0075) was carefully selected to meet the p95/p99 error ≤ 1% requirement. The implementation was extensively tested with various distributions (uniform, normal, exponential, log-normal, bimodal) to ensure accuracy guarantees are met across all cases.

## Recommendations for Future Work
- Implement compression for serialized sketches to reduce network transfer size
- Add support for negative values via offset transformation
- Implement additional statistical functions (e.g., histograms, moment calculations)
- Create visualization tools for sketch data
- Add support for more distribution types in accuracy testing

## Final Status
Implementation is: COMPLETE

### Next Steps
Proceed to implementation of the next module according to the blueprint.
