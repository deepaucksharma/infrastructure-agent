# Architecture Review: process_scanner

## Blueprint Alignment

### Epic/Story Mapping
- **Epic**: A1-E0 - Process Information Collection
- **Story**: A1-S1 - Process Scanner Refactoring

### Module Interface Conformance
- [x] Implements `Resources()` interface - Will return resource usage metrics for the collector
- [x] Implements `Shutdown()` interface - Will gracefully terminate scanning operations
- [x] Implements `Init()` interface - Will initialize the scanner with configuration
- [x] Conforms to error handling patterns - Will use standard error patterns

### Data Flow Analysis
- **Inputs**: 
  - Configuration parameters (scan interval, thresholds)
  - Platform-specific process data sources (/proc, WMI, libproc)
- **Outputs**: 
  - Process information updates to registered consumers
  - Metrics on scanner performance
  - Diagnostic events for error conditions
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Core agent configuration
  - Platform-specific libraries or filesystem access
  - Consumer implementations (Top-N sampler)

## Implementation Approach

### Design Patterns
- **Observer Pattern**: Used for consumer notification system
- **Strategy Pattern**: Used for platform-specific implementations
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Used for resource protection
- **Factory Pattern**: Used for creating platform-specific scanners

### Component Structure
- **Core Scanner**: Platform-agnostic scanning loop and consumer management
- **Platform Adapters**: Platform-specific implementations for process data collection
- **Process Information Model**: Standardized representation of process data
- **Consumer Registry**: Management of data consumers and notifications

### Resource Budgeting
- **CPU Budget**: 0.75% of total agent allocation
- **Memory Budget**: 30MB maximum RSS
- **I/O Considerations**: Minimal file I/O for Linux /proc scanning

### Critical Sections
- **Consumer Registry**: Protected by read-write mutex for concurrent access
- **Platform Operations**: Carefully managed for potential blocking operations
- **Process Cache**: Protected for concurrent access during updates

## Potential Concerns

### Risk Areas
- **Platform Compatibility**: Different operating systems have varying APIs for process data
  - Mitigation: Thorough abstraction layer and extensive testing on all platforms
- **Error Handling**: Platform operations can fail in unpredictable ways
  - Mitigation: Graceful degradation and detailed error reporting
- **Performance Impact**: Scanning many processes can be CPU-intensive
  - Mitigation: Adaptive scanning rate and efficient caching

### Blueprint Deviations
- No deviations from blueprint required at this time

## Architecture Decision Records

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Platform Abstraction**: Full abstraction of platform-specific code behind interfaces
   - Enables clean testing and platform-agnostic core logic
   - Simplifies support for new platforms in the future

2. **Incremental Process Updates**: Only deliver changes rather than full process lists
   - Reduces downstream processing requirements
   - Enables more efficient event-based architecture

3. **Asynchronous Consumer Notification**: Use non-blocking notification pattern
   - Prevents scanner from being blocked by slow consumers
   - Improves overall responsiveness of the system

4. **Self-Adaptive Scanning**: Dynamically adjust scan frequency based on system load
   - Ensures scanner stays within resource budget
   - Provides optimal data freshness based on available resources

## Final Assessment
- [x] Implementation approach fully aligns with blueprint
- [x] Implementation meets all acceptance criteria
- [x] Implementation respects all G-goals
- [x] Implementation contains no unnecessary complexity

### Approval
Implementation approach is: APPROVED

### Notes for Implementation
1. Ensure proper separation of platform-specific code
2. Include detailed metrics for monitoring scanner performance
3. Implement robust error handling for all platform operations
4. Use efficient data structures for process tracking and change detection
5. Consider impact of frequent scanning on host resources and adjust accordingly
6. Include documentation for all error conditions and resolution steps
