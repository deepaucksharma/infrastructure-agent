# Implementation Results: process_scanner

## Summary
Successfully implemented a robust Process Scanner that efficiently gathers information about running processes on the host system. The implementation includes cross-platform support, event-based process lifecycle detection, adaptive scanning rate based on system load, and comprehensive metrics for monitoring. The scanner provides a foundation for other components (like the Top-N sampler) to receive process information through a thread-safe consumer notification system.

## Documentation Updates
- **Runbook**: Added comprehensive sections on Process Scanner:
  - Configuration parameters
  - Metrics and events
  - Diagnostic procedures for common issues
  - Operational scenarios:
    - Configuring Process Scanner for High-Process Environments
    - Managing Process Scanner in Container Environments
- **Changelog**: Added entries for Process Scanner implementation and core collector module

## Implementation Notes
The implementation uses a platform abstraction approach to handle OS-specific differences in process data collection. This enables clean cross-platform support while maintaining a consistent API for consumers.

Key technical aspects:
1. **Event-based Architecture**: The scanner detects process lifecycle events (creation, update, termination) and notifies registered consumers asynchronously.
2. **Adaptive Scanning**: The scanner automatically adjusts its scan rate based on CPU usage to stay within resource limits.
3. **Efficient Filtering**: Configurable regex-based inclusion/exclusion patterns allow focusing on specific processes.
4. **Performance Optimization**: The implementation uses efficient data structures and algorithms for process tracking and change detection.
5. **Resource Protection**: Self-monitoring for CPU and memory usage with circuit breaker pattern.

The scanner is designed to integrate with the existing Top-N sampler, providing it with accurate and timely process information. The consumer interface allows for easy registration of new components that need process data.

## Recommendations for Future Work
- Implement more detailed platform-specific process attribute collection
- Add process group and session tracking
- Implement hierarchical process tree construction
- Add support for container-specific attributes (container ID, pod name, etc.)
- Enhance filtering capabilities with more complex expressions
- Implement process command-line argument parsing for better filtering
- Optimize platform-specific implementations for higher performance
- Add caching mechanisms for frequent process lookups

## Final Status
Implementation is: COMPLETE

### Next Steps
Proceed with the implementation of the OTLP exporter to complete Milestone 4.
