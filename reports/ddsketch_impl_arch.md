# Architecture Review: ddsketch_impl

## Blueprint Alignment

### Epic/Story Mapping
- **Epic**: A2-E1 - Statistical Aggregation
- **Story**: A2-S2 - DDSketch Implementation

### Module Interface Conformance
- [x] Implements `Resources()` interface - Will return resource usage metrics for the sketch
- [x] Implements `Shutdown()` interface - Will gracefully terminate any background operations
- [x] Implements `Init()` interface - Will initialize the sketch with configuration
- [x] Conforms to error handling patterns - Will use standard error patterns

### Data Flow Analysis
- **Inputs**: 
  - Metric values (float64)
  - Configuration parameters (γ, collapse threshold)
  - Serialized sketches for merging
- **Outputs**: 
  - Quantile estimates (p50, p95, p99, etc.)
  - Serialized representation
  - Resource usage metrics
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Core agent configuration
  - Protobuf libraries for serialization

## Implementation Approach

### Algorithms & Data Structures
- **DDSketch Algorithm**: Provides guaranteed relative error bounds for quantile estimation
  - Implementation based on original paper: "DDSketch: A fast and fully-mergeable quantile sketch with relative-error guarantees" (Masson, Rim, Lee)
- **Sparse Store**: Hash map of bucket index to count for memory efficiency in sparse distributions
  - O(1) lookups, O(k) space where k is number of unique bucket indices
  - Automatic bucket collapsing to maintain memory efficiency
- **Dense Store**: Array-based storage for performance in dense distributions
  - O(1) lookups, O(n) space where n is the range of bucket indices
  - More efficient for narrow value ranges
- **Logarithmic Mapping**: Bucket indexing based on logarithmic mapping
  - Ensures relative error guarantees
  - Efficient computation using bit manipulation

### Resource Budgeting
- **CPU Budget**: 0.3% of total agent allocation
- **Memory Budget**: 20MB maximum RSS
- **I/O Considerations**: Serialized size directly impacts network usage

### Critical Sections
- **Sketch Updates**: Protected by read-write mutex for concurrent access
- **Store Switching**: Atomic operations for thread safety when switching between sparse and dense

## Potential Concerns

### Risk Areas
- **Accuracy vs Memory Trade-offs**: Lower γ values provide better accuracy but require more memory
  - Mitigation: Configurable γ parameter with recommended defaults
- **Pathological Distributions**: Certain distributions could challenge accuracy guarantees
  - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing with various distributions
- **Concurrent Access Patterns**: High-frequency updates from multiple goroutines could cause contention
  - Mitigation: Fine-grained locking and lock-free operations where possible

### Blueprint Deviations
- No deviations from blueprint required at this time

## Architecture Decision Records

### ADR References
- ADR-001: The statistical fidelity requirements (γ = 0.0075) will guide the implementation
  - This γ value ensures p95/p99 error ≤ 1% as required by G-3

## Final Assessment
- [x] Implementation approach fully aligns with blueprint
- [x] Implementation meets all acceptance criteria
- [x] Implementation respects all G-goals
- [x] Implementation contains no unnecessary complexity

### Approval
Implementation approach is: APPROVED

### Notes for Implementation
1. The γ parameter (0.0075) has been carefully chosen to meet the p95/p99 error ≤ 1% requirement
2. Provide both sparse and dense store implementations to optimize for different distributions
3. Implement automatic store switching based on observed distribution characteristics
4. Ensure proper synchronization for thread safety
5. Add extensive unit tests to verify accuracy guarantees
6. Optimize serialization for minimal wire size
7. Consider adding optional compression for further size reduction
