## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Process Scanner implementation with the following features:
  - Efficient process collection on multiple platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS)
  - Event-based detection of process creation, updates, and termination
  - Adaptive scanning rate based on system load
  - Configurable inclusion/exclusion filters
  - Thread-safe consumer notification system
  - Self-monitoring for CPU and memory usage
- Core collector module with interfaces and configuration
