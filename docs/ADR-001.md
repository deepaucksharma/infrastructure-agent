# Architectural Decision Record: Statistical Data Structures

## Context
The infrastructure agent needs to capture and represent process resource usage statistics with high accuracy while minimizing the overhead on the host system.

## Decision
We will use the DDSketch algorithm for statistical summaries with the following parameters:
- Relative accuracy parameter (γ) = 0.0075
- Initial bucket capacity = 128
- Use sparse representation for memory efficiency

## Rationale
- DDSketch provides accuracy guarantees for quantile estimation
- The chosen γ value ensures p95/p99 error ≤ 1%
- Sparse representation optimizes for memory usage
- Implementation is well-tested and has predictable performance characteristics

## Consequences
- Positive: Meets G-3 (Statistical Fidelity) requirements
- Positive: Enables accurate percentile calculations with bounded error
- Negative: Slightly more complex than simple histogram
- Negative: Requires careful implementation of sparse representation

## Implementation Notes
- Use Go implementation from DataDog's DDSketch library
- Add custom serialization for Proto transport
- Implement incremental updates to minimize CPU impact

(Note: This is a placeholder. In a real implementation, this would be a detailed ADR with technical specifics.)
