# Resilient Infrastructure-Agent Telemetry Foundation Blueprint

## Overview
This blueprint outlines the architecture and components of the Resilient Infrastructure-Agent Telemetry Foundation, designed to provide high-fidelity process monitoring with statistical accuracy and host safety guarantees.

## Core Components

### 1. Collector Module
Responsible for gathering raw telemetry data from the host system.

### 2. Sampler Module
Implements efficient sampling strategies including top-N process capture.

### 3. Sketch Module
Statistical data structures for accurate percentile calculations.

### 4. Watchdog Module
Self-governance and circuit breaker functionality.

## Key Epics
